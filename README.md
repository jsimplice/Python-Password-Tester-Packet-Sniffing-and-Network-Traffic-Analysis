# Python-Password-Tester-Packet-Sniffing-and-Network-Traffic-Analysis
These codes were made for my midterm project in cybersecurity showcasing password testing strength and packet sniffing and network traffic analysis using wireshark, vscode, and powershell.
# For projectpt1.py, it's a python script that tests the strength of passwords entered by the user, it will then calculate a score based on length, use of lowercase/uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It will then assign a strength depending on the password using the aforementioned variables.
# The second part, projectpt2 is using scapy to capture and analyze network packets. The callback functions print packet summaries or log source & destination IPs. The sniffing examples I used were capturing any packets into .pcap files with wrcap, and in order to properly view the capture.pcap file, it's best to open it with wireshark. The capture_and_save function automates capturing a set number of packets and putting them into file.
